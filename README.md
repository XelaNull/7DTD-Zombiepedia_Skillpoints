Add Encyclopedia books to the world that can be found as random loot only.

Each Encyclopedia book adds 2 skill points and can only be read one time. However, a Journal entry is added with the contents of each Zombiepedia volume that is read. This allows the player to re-read the Zombiepedia volume again.

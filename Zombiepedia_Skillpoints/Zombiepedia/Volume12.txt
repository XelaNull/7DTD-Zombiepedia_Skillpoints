12.1: Zombies will take the path of least resistance to get to you. While in an underground base this may mean digging from the surface to get down to you. Make sure in any hole you dig in the ground you place multiple layers of concrete or steel between you and the surface, and provide something like a fall trap or easy way for them to get to you. This controls the flow of zombies to where you want them. - Shouden Kalferas\n
